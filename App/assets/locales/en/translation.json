  "ml-introduction": "<b>Welcome</b> to the learning page focused on essential properties in machine learning (ML). In this module, we'll delve into key properties that significantly impact the training and performance of ML models. Understanding these properties is fundamental for building effective and robust ML systems.",
  "neural-network": "Neural network",
  "neural-network-text": "Neural network is a computer system inspired by the structure and functioning of the human brain. It's used for solving problems that are too complex for traditional algorithms. Neural networks consist of interconnected nodes, called neurons, arranged in layers. These networks can learn patterns and relationships from data, making them powerful tools for tasks like image recognition, language translation, and predictive analysis.",
  "components-of-neural-network": "Components of a Neural Network",
  "neurons": "Neurons",
  "neurons-text": "Neurons are the basic building blocks of a neural network. They receive input, process it, and produce an output. Neurons are organized into layers: input layer, hidden layers, and output layer.",
  "layers": "Layers",
  "dense": "Dense",
  "dense-text": "<b>Dense</b> layer, also known as a fully connected layer, is a fundamental building block in neural networks. Imagine it as a layer where every neuron is connected to every neuron in the previous and next layers. Each neuron in a dense layer receives input from all neurons in the previous layer and produces an output value. Dense layers are commonly used for learning patterns in data and making predictions. For example, in a simple neural network for image classification, the first dense layer might receive flattened pixel values of an image as input and learn to recognize patterns in the data, such as edges or shapes.",
  "dropout": "Dropout",
  "dropout-text": "<b>Dropout</b> is a regularization technique used to prevent overfitting in neural networks. It works by randomly dropping a certain percentage of neurons (along with their connections) during training, effectively forcing the network to learn more robust and generalizable features. Dropout helps prevent the network from relying too heavily on specific neurons or features, making it less likely to memorize the training data and better able to generalize to unseen data. For example, in a dropout layer with a dropout rate of 0.5, each neuron has a 50% chance of being temporarily dropped during training.",
  "conv2D": "Convolutional 2D",
  "conv2D-text": "<b>Convolutional 2D (Conv2D)</b> layer is a fundamental component of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are widely used for tasks like image recognition and object detection. Conv2D layers apply a convolution operation to the input data, sliding a small filter (also known as a kernel) across the input image to extract features. This process helps the network learn hierarchical representations of the input data, capturing patterns at different levels of abstraction. For example, in image classification, the first Conv2D layer might learn low-level features like edges and textures, while subsequent layers learn higher-level features like shapes and objects.",
  "max-poling2D": "MaxPooling2D",
  "max-poling2D-text": "<b>MaxPooling2D</b> is a pooling operation commonly used in CNNs to reduce the spatial dimensions of feature maps while retaining important information. It works by dividing the input feature map into non-overlapping regions and retaining only the maximum value within each region. This reduces the computational complexity of the network and helps prevent overfitting by reducing the number of parameters. For example, in an image classification CNN, MaxPooling2D layers are typically used to downsample feature maps after convolutional layers, reducing their spatial resolution while preserving the most relevant information.",
  "batch-size": "Batch Size",
  "batch-size-text": "Batch size determines the number of training examples used in one iteration of training. Larger batch sizes can speed up training but require more memory, while smaller batch sizes can lead to more stable training. Adjust batch size based on hardware constraints and dataset characteristics to achieve optimal training performance.",
  "dataset-split": "Dataset split",
  "training": "Training",
  "training-text": "<b>The training</b> set is the set of data used to train the model. It comprises a large portion of the available data and is the basis for model parameter estimation. The training set must include all the possible inputs the model can process. For example, if your model must classify pictures of cats and dogs, the training set must include both cats and dogs.",
  "validation": "Validation",
  "validation-text": "<b>The validation</b> set, sometimes called the development set, is an intermediary between the training and test sets. Its primary purpose is to fine-tune the model's hyperparameters and assess its performance during training. Unlike the test set, the validation set is used iteratively during the model development. By evaluating the model's performance on the validation set, we can make informed decisions about adjusting hyperparameters, selecting the best-performing model, or identifying potential overfitting or underfitting issues.",
  "testing": "Testing",
  "testing-text": "<b>The test</b> set is a separate subset of the data withheld during the training phase. It is an unbiased benchmark to evaluate the model's performance after training. The test set simulates real-world data that the model is likely to encounter in production. By assessing the model's performance on previously unseen examples, we can gauge its ability to generalize and make accurate predictions on new, unseen data.",
  "weights-bias": "Weights and Bias",
  "weights-bias-text": "Each connection between neurons has a weight associated with it, which determines the strength of the connection. The network learns by adjusting these weights based on the input data. Additionally, each neuron has a bias term that helps control the output of that neuron.",
  "target": "Target",
  "target-text": "In machine learning (ML), the target, also known as the target variable or dependent variable, is the variable that the model aims to predict or estimate based on the input features.",
  "learning-rate": "Learning Rate",
  "learning-rate-text": "Learning rate controls the step size at which the model's parameters are updated during training. Proper selection of the learning rate is crucial for achieving fast convergence without overshooting or getting stuck in local minima. Experiment with different learning rates and consider using adaptive learning rate algorithms for improved performance.",
  "epoch": "Epoch",
  "epoch-text": "In machine learning, an epoch represents one complete iteration through the entire training dataset, where the model updates its parameters based on the training examples to minimize the loss function. During each epoch, the dataset is divided into batches, and the model sequentially processes each batch, performing forward and backward propagation to compute gradients and update parameters using an optimization algorithm such as gradient descent. Training for multiple epochs allows the model to iteratively learn from the dataset, improving its performance over time, but it's crucial to monitor for overfitting by evaluating performance on a separate validation dataset. Adjusting the number of epochs is essential to achieve optimal generalization performance without overfitting.",
  "datasets": "Dataset",
  "dataset-bold" : "Datasets",
  "datasets-introduction": " are structured collections of data used for analysis, research, or training machine learning models. They consist of individual data points, each representing an observation or sample, along with attributes or features describing those samples.",

  "tabular-subtext-1": ", often likened to a spreadsheet, is structured in rows and columns. Each row represents an individual observation, while each column denotes a specific attribute or feature associated with that observation.",
  "tabular-subtext-2": "In simpler terms, think of it as an organized table where each row describes something, like a customer's information or a product's characteristics. For instance, in a customer database, each row might represent a different customer, with columns containing details such as their age, gender, and purchase history.",
  "tabular-subtext-3": "Labels in tabular datasets typically indicate what we're trying to predict or understand, like whether a customer will make a purchase or not. This type of data is commonly used in predictive modeling and decision-making tasks, making it a fundamental aspect of machine learning for analyzing and understanding structured information.",
  "classification-bold": "Image classification",
  "classification-subtext-1": " involves teaching a computer to recognize and assign labels to images based on their contents. Imagine teaching a child to differentiate between different animals in a picture bo ok - it's a similar concept.",
  "classification-subtext-2": "In image classification datasets, images are categorized into predefined classes or categories, such as 'dog', 'cat, or 'car.' These datasets are crucial for training algorithms to automatically recognize and classify objects in images, enabling applications like facial recognition, autonomous driving, and medical imaging. Labels in image classification datasets specify the correct category or class for each image, guiding the learning process and enabling the model to make accurate predictions.",
  "classification-subtext-3": "In programming and machine learning, understanding image classification datasets is a fundamental step towards building models that can interpret visual information effectively.",
  "detection-bold": "Object detection",
  "detection-subtext-1": " goes beyond simple classification by identifying and locating multiple objects within an image. It's like having a computer scan a picture and draw boxes around different items, indicating what they are and where they're located.",
  "detection-subtext-2": "In datasets for object detection tasks, images are annotated with bounding boxes around objects of interest, along with labels specifying the class of each object. For instance, in a street scene, objects like cars, pedestrians, and traffic lights may be annotated with bounding boxes and corresponding labels.",
  "detection-subtext-3": "Object detection is crucial for applications like surveillance, autonomous navigation, and augmented reality, as it enables machines to perceive and interact with their surroundings in a detailed manner.",
